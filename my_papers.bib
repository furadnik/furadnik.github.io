	abstract = {Cooperative game theory has diverse applications in contemporary
	            artificial intelligence, including domains like interpretable
	            machine learning, resource allocation, and collaborative
	            decision-making. However, specifying a cooperative game entails
	            assigning values to exponentially many coalitions, and obtaining
	            even a single value can be resource-intensive in practice. Yet
	            simply leaving certain coalition values undisclosed introduces
	            ambiguity regarding individual contributions to the collective
	            grand coalition. This ambiguity often leads to players holding
	            overly optimistic expectations, stemming from either inherent
	            biases or strategic considerations, frequently resulting in
	            collective claims exceeding the actual grand coalition value. In
	            this paper, we present a framework aimed at optimizing the sequence
	            for revealing coalition values, with the overarching goal of
	            efficiently closing the gap between players' expectations and
	            achievable outcomes in cooperative games. Our contributions are
	            threefold: (i) we study the individual players' optimistic
	            completions of games with missing coalition values along with the
	            arising gap, and investigate its analytical characteristics that
	            facilitate more efficient optimization; (ii) we develop methods to
	            minimize this gap over classes of games with a known prior by
	            disclosing values of additional coalitions in both offline and
	            online fashion; and (iii) we empirically demonstrate the
	            algorithms' performance in practical scenarios, together with an
	            investigation into the typical order of revealing coalition values.
