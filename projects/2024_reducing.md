# Reducing Optimism Bias in Incomplete Cooperative Games

In this paper, we investigate how to minimize the amount of information we
learn about a cooperative game, while getting an accurate estimation of the
Shapley value.

This paper was written by me, [David Sychrovský](https://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~sychrovsky/), [Jakub Černý](https://www.cernyjakub.com/) and [Martin Černý](https://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~cerny/).
It was accepted to the [23rd International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems](https://www.aamas2024-conference.auckland.ac.nz/) in Auckland, New Zealand.

For this paper, I received the [Prize of Jirka Matoušek](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en/kam/research/prize-of-jirka-matousek) 2024.

The paper can be accessed in the Proceedings [here](https://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2024/pdfs/p1847.pdf).
However, we recommend getting the version from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01930), in which we fixed some minor mistakes:

1. The error bars were changed to be the _standard error of the mean_, as is more common in literature (previously was the standard deviation of the values).
2. A typo was fixed in the statement of Proposition 3.4 (an extra $-v(N)$ after the second equals sign).
