# Maximizing Truth Learning in a Social Network is NP-hard

This paper is a continuation of my work at [REU 2024](/projects/2024_reu).

We look at the problem of truth learning with unreliable information in a social network.
We analyze the complexity of deciding _how well_ a given network can learn.
We reach the conclusion that this problem is in fact NP-hard.
For more information, see the REU website.

This paper was written by me and [Amanda Wang](https://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/~aw1115/) with equal contribution, and by [Jie Gao](https://sites.rutgers.edu/jie-gao/about/).
It was accepted to the [24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems](https://aamas2025.org/) in Detroit, United States.
