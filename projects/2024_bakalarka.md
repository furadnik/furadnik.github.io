# Bachelor Thesis

I did my bachelor thesis on _Balancing Space Complexity and Ambiguity in Superadditive Set Functions_.
My supervisor was [Mgr. David Sychrovský](https://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~sychrovsky/) and my consultant was [RNDr. Martin Černý](https://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~cerny/).

The thesis is an extension of the paper [Reducing Optimism Bias in Incomplete Cooperative Games](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=7AvTiqgAAAAJ&citation_for_view=7AvTiqgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC) to a more general setting of set functions.

The original version of the thesis can be found on the [Charles University Digital Repository](http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11956/193133), or on [Github](https://github.com/furadnik/bakalarka/releases/tag/official).
However, since then, some minor mistakes were discovered.
I have fixed those, and the corrected version can be reached as the latest release on [Github](https://github.com/furadnik/bakalarka/releases/tag/latest).
The Github repository also contains the source code with a record of all changes made since the submitted version.
