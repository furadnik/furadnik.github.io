# Filip&nbsp;Úradník

I am a master's student in computer science at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en).
Though I usually prefer purely theoretical projects, I also enjoy projects that blend theory and application.
I am passionate about free and open source software and all things Neovim.
